<b>03/2021: DeepSpeed is hiring! Come join us: [SDE 2](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/1013160/Software-Engineer-2), [Sr. SDE](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/1017151/Senior-Software-Engineer), [Sr. Researcher](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/1016440/Senior-Researcher)</b>

DeepSpeed is a deep learning optimization library that makes distributed training easy,
efficient, and effective.

<p align="center"><i><b>10x Larger Models</b></i></p>
<p align="center"><i><b>10x Faster Training</b></i></p>
<p align="center"><i><b>Minimal Code Change</b></i></p>

DeepSpeed delivers extreme-scale model training for everyone, from data scientists training on massive supercomputers to those training on low-end clusters or even on a single GPU:
* Extreme scale: Using current generation of GPU clusters with hundreds of devices,  3D parallelism of DeepSpeed can efficiently train deep learning models with trillions of parameters.
* Extremely memory efficient: With just a single GPU, ZeRO-Offload of DeepSpeed can train models with over 10B parameters, 10x bigger than the state of arts, democratizing multi-billion-parameter model training such that many deep learning scientists can explore bigger and better models.
* Extremely long sequence length: Sparse attention of DeepSpeed powers an order-of-magnitude longer input sequence and obtains up to 6x faster execution comparing with dense transformers.
* Extremely communication efficient: 3D parallelism improves communication efficiency allows users to train multi-billion-parameter models 2â€“7x faster on clusters with limited network bandwidth.  1-bit Adam/1-bit LAMB reduce communication volume by up to 5x while achieving similar convergence efficiency to Adam/LAMB, allowing for scaling to different types of GPU clusters and networks.

Early adopters of DeepSpeed have already produced
a language model (LM) with over 17B parameters called
[Turing-NLG](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft),
establishing a new SOTA in the LM category.

DeepSpeed is an important part of Microsoftâ€™s new
[AI at Scale](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ai-at-scale/)
initiative to enable next-generation AI capabilities at scale, where you can find more
information [here](https://innovation.microsoft.com/en-us/exploring-ai-at-scale).

# Extreme Speed and Scale for DL Training and Inference

   ***[DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) enables world's most powerful language models like [MT-530B](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/using-deepspeed-and-megatron-to-train-megatron-turing-nlg-530b-the-worlds-largest-and-most-powerful-generative-language-model/) and [BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/blog/bloom-megatron-deepspeed)***. It is an easy-to-use deep learning optimization software suite that powers unprecedented scale and speed for both training and inference. With DeepSpeed you can:

* DeepSpeed trains BERT-large to parity in 14 hours using 64 GPUs (4 DGX-2 boxes) and in
  3.7 hours using 256 GPUs (16 DGX-2 boxes).

  **BERT-large Training Times**

  | Devices       | Source    | Training Time (hours) |
  | ------------- | --------- | ---------------------:|
  | 64 TPUs       | Google    |                    96 |
  | 64 V100 GPUs  | DeepSpeed |                **14** |
  | 256 V100 GPUs | NVIDIA    |                   3.9 |
  | 256 V100 GPUs | DeepSpeed |               **3.7** |

  *BERT Tutorial*: Coming Soon

* DeepSpeed trains GPT2 (1.5 billion parameters) 3.75x faster than state-of-art, NVIDIA
  Megatron on Azure GPUs.

## DeepSpeed-Inference

DeepSpeed brings together innovations in parallelism technology such as tensor, pipeline, expert and ZeRO-parallelism, and combines them with high-performance custom inference kernels, communication optimizations and heterogeneous memory technologies to enable inference at an unprecedented scale, while achieving unparalleled latency, throughput and cost reduction. This systematic composition of system technologies for inference falls under the DeepSpeed-Inference. Learn more: [DeepSpeed-Inference](https://www.deepspeed.ai/inference)

1-bit Adam and 1-bit LAMB reduce communication volume by up to 5x while achieving similar convergence efficiency to Adam, allowing for scaling to different types of GPU clusters and networks.  [1-bit Adam blog post](https://www.deepspeed.ai/news/2020/09/08/onebit-adam-blog-post.html), [1-bit Adam tutorial](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/onebit-adam/), [1-bit LAMB tutorial](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/onebit-lamb/).

## Supporting long sequence length
DeepSpeed offers sparse attention kernelsâ€”an instrumental technology to support long sequences of model inputs, whether for text, image, or sound. Compared with the classic dense Transformers, it powers **an order-of-magnitude longer input sequence** and obtains up to 6x faster execution with comparable accuracy. It also outperforms state-of-the-art sparse implementations with 1.5â€“3x faster execution. Furthermore, our sparse kernels support efficient execution of flexible sparse format and empower users to innovate on their custom sparse structures.  [Read more here](https://www.deepspeed.ai/news/2020/09/08/sparse-attention.html).


## Fast convergence for effectiveness
DeepSpeed supports advanced hyperparameter tuning and large batch size
optimizers such as [LAMB](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00962). These improve the
effectiveness of model training and reduce the number of samples required to
convergence to desired accuracy.

In line with Microsoft's mission to solve humanity's most pressing challenges, the DeepSpeed team at Microsoft is responding to this opportunity by launching a new initiative called *DeepSpeed4Science*, aiming to build unique capabilities through AI system technology innovations to help domain experts to unlock today's biggest science mysteries.
