DeepSpeed can train DL models with over a hundred billion parameters on current
generation of GPU clusters, while achieving over 10x in system performance
compared to the state-of-art. Early adopters of DeepSpeed have already produced
a language model (LM) with over 17B parameters called
[Turing-NLG](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft),
establishing a new SOTA in the LM category.

DeepSpeed is an important part of Microsoftâ€™s new
[AI at Scale](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ai-at-scale/)
initiative to enable next-generation AI capabilities at scale, where you can find more
information [here](https://innovation.microsoft.com/en-us/exploring-ai-at-scale).

# Extreme Speed and Scale for DL Training and Inference

   ***[DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) enables world's most powerful language models like [MT-530B](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/using-deepspeed-and-megatron-to-train-megatron-turing-nlg-530b-the-worlds-largest-and-most-powerful-generative-language-model/) and [BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/blog/bloom-megatron-deepspeed)***. It is an easy-to-use deep learning optimization software suite that powers unprecedented scale and speed for both training and inference. With DeepSpeed you can:

* DeepSpeed trains BERT-large to parity in 14 hours using 64 GPUs (4 DGX-2 boxes) and in
  3.7 hours using 256 GPUs (16 DGX-2 boxes).

  **BERT-large Training Times**

  | Devices       | Source    | Training Time (hours) |
  | ------------- | --------- | ---------------------:|
  | 64 TPUs       | Google    |                    96 |
  | 64 V100 GPUs  | DeepSpeed |                **14** |
  | 256 V100 GPUs | NVIDIA    |                   3.9 |
  | 256 V100 GPUs | DeepSpeed |               **3.7** |

  *BERT Tutorial*: Coming Soon

* DeepSpeed trains GPT2 (1.5 billion parameters) 3.75x faster than state-of-art, NVIDIA
  Megatron on Azure GPUs.
