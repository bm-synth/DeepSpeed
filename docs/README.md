# DeepSpeed Documentation

This directory includes the documentation of DeepSpeed. There are three ways to read it:

## 1. Access [deepspeed.ai](https://www.deepspeed.ai/)

This is the most recommended way to read the documentation.

## 2. Directly read files in this directory

We do not recommend this way because this directory is organized to build the [deepspeed.ai](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) website using Jekyll. Thus some of the files actually are not DeepSpeed documentation. In addition, some of the url links in the documentation only work through the webpages generated by Jekyll.

## 3. Build [deepspeed.ai](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) website locally using Jekyll


Now we can install Jekyll and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/):
```
gem install jekyll bundler
```

### Start a local webserver
We now need to install the required Ruby packages for the website.

**NOTE**: you should change to this folder (i.e., docs) before running the installation command to avoid this [error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10012181/bundle-install-returns-could-not-locate-gemfile/35157872):

> Could not locate Gemfile

**NOTE**: this step frequently hangs when connected to a VPN (including MSVPN). Simply disconnect for the package installation.


```
bundle install
```

You can now start a local webserver via:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
The website should now be accessible at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
